**CryptoDash** is an IoT (Internet of Things) dashboarding software based around:

- **React Native** for the **front end**

- **NodeJs** for the **backend/server**

- **MongoDb** for **User data**
 


**‚öõÔ∏èReact Native** is used due to its fast development time and ability to scale to a variety of different devices easily

**üñ•Ô∏èNodeJs** is used because the rest of this project is coded using **Javascript**

**üçÉMongoDB** is used because we are streaming large amounts of sensor data
